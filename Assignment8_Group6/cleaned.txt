trump
responded
to
the
boards
ruling
in
a
statement
what
facebook
twitter
and
google
have
done
is
a
total
disgrace
and
an
embarrassment
to
our
country
free
speech
has
been
taken
away
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
because
the
radical
left
lunatics
are
afraid
of
the
truth
but
the
truth
will
come
out
anyway
bigger
and
stronger
than
ever
before
the
people
of
our
country
will
not
stand
for
it
these
corrupt
social
media
companies
must
pay
a
political
price
and
must
never
again
be
allowed
to
destroy
and
decimate
our
electoral
process
in
a
separate
statement
released
on
wednesday
trump
again
baselessly
claimed
there
was
fraud
in
the
2020
election
within
six
months
facebook
must
reexamine
the
arbitrary
penalty
it
imposed
on
january
7
and
decide
the
appropriate
penalty
the
board
said
wednesday
this
penalty
must
be
based
on
the
gravity
of
the
violation
and
the
prospect
of
future
harm
it
must
also
be
consistent
with
facebooks
rules
for
severe
violations
which
must
in
turn
be
clear
necessary
and
proportionate
it
is
not
permissible
for
facebook
to
keep
a
user
off
the
platform
for
an
undefined
period
with
no
criteria
for
when
or
whether
the
account
will
be
restored
the
board
said
the
board
claimed
that
facebook
gave
trumps
account
a
vague
standardless
penalty
and
then
tried
to
avoid
its
responsibilities
by
sending
the
case
to
the
board
to
resolve
if
facebook
decides
to
restore
mr
trumps
accounts
the
company
should
apply
its
rules
to
that
decision
including
any
changes
made
in
response
to
the
boards
policy
recommendations
below
the
boards
ruling
said
in
this
scenario
facebook
must
address
any
further
violations
promptly
and
in
accordance
with
its
established
content
policies
as
part
of
the
boards
examination
trump
was
allowed
to
provide
a
statement
which
was
submitted
by
the
american
center
for
law
and
justice
on
his
behalf
the
statement
denies
that
trumps
comments
lead
to
the
capitol
siege
it
is
stunningly
clear
that
in
his
speech
there
was
no
call
to
insurrection
no
incitement
to
violence
and
no
threat
to
public
safety
in
any
manner
and
that
there
is
a
total
absence
of
any
serious
linkage
between
the
trump
speech
and
the
capitol
building
incursion
the
statement
also
claimed
that
all
genuine
trump
political
supporters
were
law-abiding
and
that
the
incursion
was
certainly
influenced
and
most
probably
ignited
by
outside
forces
in
response
to
the
boards
ruling
facebook
said
we
will
now
consider
the
boards
decision
and
determine
an
action
that
is
clear
and
proportionate
in
the
meantime
mr
trumps
accounts
remain
suspended
the
board
also
made
a
number
of
recommendations
on
how
we
should
improve
our
policies
facebook
said
while
these
recommendations
are
not
binding
we
actively
sought
the
boards
views
on
our
policies
around
political
figures
and
will
carefully
review
its
recommendations
trumps
supporters
and
critics
are
reacting
to
the
boards
decision
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
tweeted
if
they
can
ban
president
trump
all
conservative
voices
could
be
next
sen
ted
cruz
r-texas
called
the
boards
ruling
disgraceful
for
every
liberal
celebrating
trumps
social
media
ban
if
the
big
tech
oligarchs
can
muzzle
the
former
president
whats
to
stop
them
from
silencing
you
cruz
tweeted
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
responded
theres
no
constitutional
protection
for
using
social
media
to
incite
an
insurrection
trump
is
willing
to
do
anything
for
himself
no
matter
the
danger
to
our
country
his
big
lies
have
cost
america
dearly
and
until
he
stops
facebook
must
ban
him
which
is
to
say
forever
trump
was
permanently
banned
from
twitter
on
jan
8
trump
told
abc
news
recently
that
the
written
statements
hes
been
issuing
during
his
social
media
ban
are
so
much
more
elegant
than
twitter
